      Todoâ€™s List is the basic project for learning basic concepts of  React Js. The To Do App that we are going to build will allow a user to add a task to a list of to-do items. Once the task is added, the user will be able to mark it as completed and delete the task once it's done. There will be a count that will be displaying the tasks.
